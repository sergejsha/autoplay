# Autoplay
Gradle plugin for publishing Android artifacts to Google Play.

# Fetures

- Autoplay is optimized for CI/CD usage:
  - it does **not** trigger artifacts assembly task - you can reuse build artifacts from previous build steps;
  - it accepts JSON key as **base64-encoded string**, which is a secure and convenient way of providing secret data.
  
- Autoplay is developer friendly:
  - it does **not** require storing any dummy keys in source control;
  - it fails just misconfigured publish-task and not the whole build on evaluation step;
  - it has a single publish task for uploading akp, mapping file and release notes.
  
- Autoplay is reliable and future-proof:
  - it has very clean and concise implementation, which is easy to understand;
  - it's covered by unit tests and easy to maintain and extend;
  - it's built using latest technologies and tools like Kotlin, Kotlin-DSL for Gradle, Android Gradle plugin etc.
 
# Usage

In the main `build.gradle`

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    google()
    jcenter()  
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "de.halfbit:autoplay:<version>"
  }
}
```

Releases of Autoplay are published to `mavenCentral()` repository. Checkout [releases](https://github.com/beworker/autoplay/releases) section to find the last release version.

In the application module's `build.gradle`

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'android-autoplay'

autoplay {
    track "internal"
    secretJsonBase64 project.hasProperty('SECRET_JSON') ? project.property('SECRET_JSON') : ''
}
```

Call `./gradlew tasks` and you will see a new publishing task `publishApk<BuildVariant>` in the list. Autoplay adds this task for each build variant of `release` type. For a project without custom build flavors configured, the task is called `publishApkRelease`.

Now you can call this task from a central build script. Here is an example of how to use it with Gitlab CI.

```yml
stages:
  - assemble
  - release

assemble:
  stage: assemble
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - ./gradlew clean assembleRelease -PSTORE_PASS=${STORE_PASS} -PKEY_PASS=${KEY_PASS}
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - app/build/outputs/

release:
  stage: release
  dependencies:
    - assemble
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - ./gradlew publishApkRelease -PSECRET_JSON=${SECRET_JSON}
```

You can encode JSON key file into base64 string using following shell command (linux, mac)

```shell
base64 -i secret.json -o -
```

and provide the value to the build script using a [protected variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#variables).

# Release Notes

Autoplay takes apk- and mapping-files for uploading from the respective build output directories. Release notes assigned to a release should be provided additionally. Autoplay expects release notes to be stored under `src/main/autoplay/release-notes` directory in accordance with the structure shown down below.

```
src
  +- main
       +- java
       +- autoplay
            +- release-notes
                 +- <track>           e.g. internal
                     +- <locale>.txt  e.g. en-US.txt
```

Happy continuous integration!
